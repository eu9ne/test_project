# De-Image

This is a Processing project designed as an art gallery installation.

De_Image is an interactive audiovisual installation that transforms your movements and sounds into a live, reactive artwork. Through a digital mirror of shifting visuals and sound, the work invites reflection on the social performance of human behaviour, and what bending these social rules within a virtual environment can reveal about ourselves. By encouraging loud noises and direct hardware interactions, De-image asks you to momentarily shed social politeness and engage playfully with your digital reflection. You are invited to let loose, follow the guiding prompts (if you wish), and explore...

**'De_Image'** is the primary project prototype file. To experience full visual and audio reactivity:
-- Download the 'Processing Video' and 'Minim Audio' libraries in Processing.
-- Connect to an in-built or external webcam, mic, speaker and mouse.
-- Enable Processing access to your webcam and mic in system settings.
-- Depending on your system load, it may take up to a few minutes for your webcam and mic to activate once the project is open.
-- For the best experience, begin with your volume at a low level where the ellipses are visible, small and desaturated.

An error message will appear onscreen if your webcam is not able to be read. To troubleshoot:
-- Close Processing and launch it from the Terminal.
-- Check your physical webcam connection by launching another camera app such as Photobooth.
-- Your operating system's privacy permissions may not be compatible with the Processing video capture. This may occur in newer Mac OS. Launch the **'De_Image_Grayscale'** file project prototype file to experience the artwork. The visual and audio reactivity is identical besides the gray shapes in the 'calm' state.
